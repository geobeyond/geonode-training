# Link GeoNode to a geonode-project instance
A `geonode-project` is basically a Django project **template** allowing us to create a brand new web project which _has GeoNode core as a dependency_.

In simple words, through this template project we are able to customize somehow our GeoNode instance without actually touching the GeoNode core code.

Thanks to the prower of Django, we are able to override **templates**, **views** and, withing certain limits, the **models**.

In this section we will learn how to:

 - Create a new `virtualenv` for our `geonode-project` instance
 - Initialize a new `geonode-project` instance called `my_geonode`
 - Modify the look-and-feel from the `my_geonode` instance
