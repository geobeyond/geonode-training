# Programmatically Customize the Look-and-Feel
In this section we will change the look and feel of GeoNode, in particular we will do some customization to help understanding how the template inheritance works and how to add new stuff to your GeoNode. The changes will include the home page, the top menu, the footer and a generic GeoNode page.

## Homepage
GeoNode provides some predefined templates to change the home page and the general site content.

In the `/opt/geonode/geonode/templates/` directory we can edit the `index.html`.

Try to edit the content of the `jumbotron box` in the page, save and refresh your browser to see the changes.

```shell
vim geonode/templates/index.html
```

```diff
diff --git a/geonode/templates/index.html b/geonode/templates/index.html

## Main Theme
To change the main theme of GeoNode we can act on the `base.css` file available in the `/opt/geonode/geonode/static/geonode/css/` folder.

**IMPORTANT**: Remember to put the rules at the end of the file, otherwise they could be overridden by some previous `CSS` rules

**WARNING**: In order to correctly persist the rules, once you are happy with the `CSS`, you will need to transform them into `LESS` and update the `/opt/geonode/geonode/static/geonode/less/base.less` file accordingly. There are plenty of online resources around the will help you doing this.

For example, if we want to change the background of the `jumbotron`, in this file we can add the following rule:

```css
.home .jumbotron { background: red }
```
Adding the `.home` class prefix is necessary in order to let the rule have priority over the GeoNodeâ€™s ones.

We can see this by inspecting the element in the developer console.

Once we refresh the browser, we should see the change as follows

## Top Navbar Menu
Let's make some changes that will apply to the whole site. We will add a `Geocollections` entry in the `top menu bar`.

Edit the `geonode_base.html` file in the `/opt/geonode/geonode/base/templates/` folder and add the following lines:

```django
{% extends "base.html" %}

{% block tabs %}
{{ block.super }}
<li>
 <a href="{{ PROJECT_ROOT }}/geocollections">Geocollections</a>
</li>
{% endblock tabs %}
```

Refresh the page and check the outcomes

In order to practice a bit more with the templates inheritance of Django, try to check what happens if you move the statement `{{ block.super }}` after the list element:

and also check what happens if you remove it completely:

This property of Django allows us to completely override the bahavior of parts of the templates accordingly to our needs.

Currently by clicking over the menu we just created throws an error. This is because the related **view** and **url pattern** do not exist yet. We will create them in the next sections.
