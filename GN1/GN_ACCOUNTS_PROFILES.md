# Accounts and User Profiles
In GeoNode many contents are public so unregistered users have read-only access to public datasets.

In order to create and edit contents on GeoNode, you need first to *sign in* and *log in* as a **Registered Member**.

GeoNode is primarily a *social platform*, thus a primary component of any GeoNode instance is the **user account**.

This section will guide you through account registration, updating your account information and preferences, connections with social networks and email addresses.

## Register to the platform as a new Member
To take full advantage of all the GeoNode features you need an user account.

Follow these step to create a new one:

 - From any page in the web interface, you will see a `Register` link. Click that link, and the register form will appear

 - On the next page, fill out the form. Enter a user name and password in the fields. Also, enter an email address.
     ```ini
     E-mail: test_user1@test.geonode.org
     Username: test_user1
     Password: test_user1
     Password (again): test_user1
     ```

- You will be automatically logged in and redirected to the GeoNode home page. On a production system, with a correctly configured `EMAIL SMTP` service, an email will be also sent confirming that you have signed up. If no errors occur during the registration, you will be able to recognize the username on the top-right side of the page:

- To logout click on the `Log out` link of the user menu.
