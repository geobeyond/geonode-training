## Django Administration Dashboard
The dashboard is a special section accessible, at least on GeoNode, only to `superusers`.

Through the dashboard an `admin` can access special functions and can interact directly with the models stored on the DB.

This is particularly usefull when we need to recover from an unusual situation, for example a layer could not successfully finish the configuation or some error occurred in the meanwhile.

Notice that the dashboard is composed by several sections. In this introductionary module we will focus on some of them, the most common ones.
