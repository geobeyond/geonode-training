# Finding Contents
With some of the metadata fields correctly updated and populated, it will be much easier to search for contents on the platform catalog.

## Quick Filters

- Move back to the `Data > Layers` list.
- Notice that the position of the `Mainrd` dataset has changed now; you should be able to see it as a first element if you correctly updated the `Publishing Date`.

- The list is ordered by `Publishing Date` descending by default; it is possible to quickly change the order of the items by clicking on the `Order` quick filter button.

- On the left column there are also a set of quick filters that can be used to further refine the list contents

    - The `TYPE` filter is expanded by default. This is the most simple one and allows you to quickly search for some specific types of datasets. A small counter also tells us how many datsets are available globally for that specific type. This is valid in general for any of those `Quick filters`.

    - By start typing on the `TEXT` filter, the system will show a content menu with the possible refined choices associated to the typing. Notice how difficult is to recognize the dataset with a _non meaningful_ title and how easy is to recognize the others instead. If you know something about the title or description of the dataset, this is one of the quickest ways to search for it.

    - Also by using the `KEYWORDS` filter will help us a lot to search for some specific contents.

    - We can use the `CATEGORIES` filter to further refine the search or to look for some specific areas of contents.

    - If we know who created the datasets, we can use the `RESPONSIBLE`, `GROUPS` and/or `GROUPS CATEGORIES` filters.

    - The `DATE` filters are very useful to refine the search by looking for specific ranges of valid dates; notice that those filters will work correctly only if you specified the `Publication Date` correctly on the dataset metadata.
